# Background

The simulation of moving sound sources represents a important issue for efficiently representing virtual worlds  and acoustic environments. But it is limited by the Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) resolution measurement, usually overcome by interpolation techniques.
In this [research][research], the proposed algorithm overcomes discontinuity of sound and the excessive calculation load problems usually raised by moving sound source spatial representation techniques, while high-quality 3D sound spatial quality is achieved.
